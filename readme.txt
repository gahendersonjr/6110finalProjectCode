---OBJECTIVE---
The objective of this project is to experiment with redistricting voting districts using the preferences
of each district. The unit could be census blocks, cities, zip code areas, etc. For this experiment random
data is assigned to each cell. This could be replaced with real data. The program finds all border cells,
calculates if a trade is wanted by both sides, makes the trade, then repeats until no trades can be made.
Then the program shows both the original map and the final map with their respective standard deviations 
to show that each district is more "happy" than they were before. The program will only make trades if it
keeps each district a continuous area.

---TO RUN--
To run this code, simple open index.html is a browser (I tested with both Firefox and Chrome, so using
one of those is best). Then, simply click the "Start Simluation" button and see the results.
